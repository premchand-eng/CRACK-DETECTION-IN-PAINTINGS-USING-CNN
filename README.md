Imported Libraries:

numpy: Numerical computing library.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
matplotlib.pyplot: Plotting library for creating visualizations.
seaborn: Data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
plotly.express: Library for interactive visualizations (though not extensively used in this code).
Path from pathlib: For working with file paths.
train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection: For splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
tensorflow (imported as tf): Deep learning library.
confusion_matrix and classification_report from sklearn.metrics: For evaluating the model.
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

generate_df function: Generates a DataFrame from image directories and labels.
Paths to positive and negative image directories are specified.
DataFrames for positive and negative samples are generated and concatenated.
The data is split into training and testing sets.
Data Generators:

tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator is used to create data generators for training and testing.
Data augmentation techniques are applied to the training data, including rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping.
Model Architecture:

A simple CNN model is defined using TensorFlow and Keras.
The model includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and a global average pooling layer.
Sigmoid activation is used in the output layer for binary classification.
Model Compilation:

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
Model Training:

The model is trained using the fit method.
Training history is stored in the history variable.
Early stopping is employed based on validation loss.
Model Evaluation and Visualization:

A function (evaluate_model) is defined to evaluate the model on the test data.
The function prints test loss, accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Confusion matrix and classification report are visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Visualization of Training History:

The training and validation loss over epochs are plotted.
Summary and Model Evaluation:

The model summary is printed.
The model is evaluated on the test data, and evaluation results are printed and visualized.
Files Outside of Code:

The code assumes the presence of image files (JPEG) in the specified positive and negative directories.
The structure and content of these directories influence the model's performance.
